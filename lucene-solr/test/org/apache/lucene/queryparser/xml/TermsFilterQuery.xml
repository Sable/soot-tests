		<!-- TermsFilter uses an analyzer to tokenize Field text and creates a filter for docs which 
			have ANY of the supplied terms. Unlike a RangeFilter this can be used for filtering on 
			multiple terms that are not necessarily in a sequence. An example might be a list of primary
			keys from a database query result or perhaps a choice of "category" labels picked by the end 
			user.
			As a filter, this is much faster than the equivalent query (a BooleanQuery with many 
			"should" TermQueries)
			
			This example might be just a list of Saturdays ie not a contiguous range of values
			which can be handled by rangefilter
